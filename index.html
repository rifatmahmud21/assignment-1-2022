                    signature program has
                    provided clean water and more than 4.5 million healthy meals to children and elderly adults in
                    poverty-stricken areas of
                    India, Ghana, and Nepal. Health has improved, school enrollment and achievement have skyrocketed,

                    your donation</h2>
                <p>The recent flood has caused havoc in Sylhet, Sunamganj and others parts of the country, leaving
                    people with no food and
                    water. Since the beginning of this crisis, JAAGO Foundation, with the help of our generous
                    supporters and volunteers,
                    have worked relentlessly and provided people with food, medicine and other necessities.
                    Standing neck-deep in flood water, volunteers are reaching out to people to provide necessary relief
                    packages. Several
                    people and organisations have come forward with aid from different places. The aids have been packed
                    up and distributed
                    to the affected families by our volunteers with great effort.</p>

                    to suvive</h2>
                <p>With the flood waters receding, there was a rise in waterborne diseases in the country. People
                    suffered from diseases
                    like diarrhoea, dysentery, fever, skin infections and other waterborne diseases. Ensuring the
                    availability of drinking
                    water was our top priority. So far, we have helped thousands of families. In addition to providing
                    clean drinking water
                    and food, our team has begun working on the post-flood situation.
